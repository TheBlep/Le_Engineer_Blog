## Visual Design
### Wireframes
Wireframes: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WwDSap35rXV1i8_9hCPBqiXvpMdoFJsQ?usp=sharing

### Fonts
<div align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44118951/92331221-6f750000-f075-11ea-8096-288bcc957e33.png" alt="Fonts">
</div>

- The primary font, [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?query=roboto) was chosen because it is minimal, and easy to read while remaining refined. As a font, it gave me the impression of something utilitarian but comfortable. Being clear, clean and simple, maintaining the idea of a minimalist aesthetic. 
- The secondary font, [Times new Roman](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/times-new-roman) was chosen because it is standard, plain and informative but not too rigid. It looks friendly and conversational but holds a seriousness. It is also serif, making it very easily readable throughout different color schemes and complementary to the font used for the blogs.
- Other fonts default to the system-ui CSS font family. This uses the default font of the user's operating system, providing a consistent and familiar appearance across different platforms.

### Icons
<div align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44118951/92331590-1fe40380-f078-11ea-814b-d15b413f59aa.png" alt="Icons">
</div>

- Icons are taken from the [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) Icon library.
- Icons are utilised in the footer for social account icons and for now only lead to the main social media website.

### Colors
<div align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44118951/92331821-a64d1500-f079-11ea-9ceb-a9b1b85872bd.png" alt="Color Pallette">
</div>

- I wanted the site to maintain a minimal and dark aesthetic, colors pop on the black background but remain, clean to highlight the content of the images and text.
- The primary color used is rich black, avoiding the designers bane of full black. This is used to create a comfortable veiwing experiance I have come to personally love. This not only helps to ease strain on the eyes but draw them directly from the logo to the content. This removes distraction, a common practice in theatre, cinemas, etc. White is often used in galleries but has more to do with lighting and reflection. On most computer screens, wherein the light is emitted from the screen, black is a better choice.
- Two accent colors were chosen, the blue to give a welcoming introduction and red to make the color contrast as well as make unmistakable the button highlights. These color choices are necessary to have an impact and lead the reader on this dark background.
- Text is primarily written in off-white to contrast on the dark color backgrounds of the primary and accent colors.

### Blogs
<div align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44118951/92332253-c7633500-f07c-11ea-8f9e-a5f03b0fe1da.png" alt="Images">
</div>

- The site has a heavy focus on blogs, using full-size quality images to draw in th veiwer.
- In the main gallery, blogs are displayed in three columns responsively, so they can easily be seen on any size device.
- Clicking on a blog will open up a full-page modal that displays the image alongside the blog content, in detail.
- The image and text will automatically space themselves vertically within the column, so the blog remains reable.

### Styling
- For this project I have utilised Bootstrap 5.3 source files to override their class defaults to my liking, making customisation much easier. The entire site can be restyled with a single switch in the code.
- Utilizing CSS, all images on the home page have rounded corners on the top, providing a comfortable enterance to the page, contrast to the harsh and often unappealing nature of sharp corners.
- As the site has a beeline focus on use, links on each page are re-used to direct the user to eitherthe home page for other blogs or the collaberation page.
- Interactivity is paramount to any blog and as such, comments are spread and easially accessable to logged in users, providing a place to share thoughts and exchange opinions.

# Features
## Page Elements
### All Pages
#### Navbar
<div align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44118951/92332641-b831b680-f07f-11ea-8ff6-d414e661b490.png" alt="Medium Header">

</div>

- Uses the[Google Maps Javascript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial) to load an interactive map.
- All features utilise javascript.
- The [Google Maps Styling Wizard](https://mapstyle.withgoogle.com/) has been used to keep the map consistent with the site pallette.
- The map zoom level is set differently depending on the device screen size.
- Map markers are automatically generated and pull info from the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.eu/).
- Adding a country name to the `countryName` variable in `map.js` will allow a marker to be created with an info window that has the country statistics already filled.
- `map.js` will automatically format the country info for the info window to be easily readable.
- The info window has been styled to be consistent with the other elements of the site.
- Content in the info window will automatically delete and refresh for each marker.
- The country information is used to swap the picture URLs in the gallery.
- Markers are animated to drop onto the map together.
- The selected marker has been set to animate on click and stop any other animated markers. A second click will stop the animation.
- After being clicked the page will briefly show the info window opening before smoothly scrolling down to the gallery automatically to carry the user to the images.
- After a short scroll down a little arrow will appear in the bottom right which can be used to scroll to the top of the page again.
- If the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.eu/) is unreachable for any reason, the `markerArray.js` file is used to produce the markers.
- In the backup function, the info window is not generated as that required the API.

#### Collaberation page
<div align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44118951/92342235-812fc500-f0c0-11ea-8867-806e010a7638.png" alt="Iframe Gallery">
</div>

- A fully responsive, javascript-backed iframe gallery.
- Displays three columns no matter the device size, so all photos are nicely displayed.
- Used as an iframe so the layout can be modified separately from the gallery data.
- Starts by displaying default images and an invitation to use the map.
- Once a map marker is clicked, the images will swap out URLs, and the countries images will show.
- Functions listen for a change to reset the image blur function.
- Information for a blurb is stored on the gallery page and injected into the loaded iframe on click.
- The swap is animated with jQuery to make it less sudden.
- Clicking on an image will insert the image source path into a modal before it pops up to display the image in full quality.
- The gallery's height can vary by photos and device, so there is a function to adjust the height.
- The function fires on page load one, and then each time a marker is clicked, after every image has loaded completely, otherwise the height set may be incorrect.
- The images in the gallery space vertically automatically based on the gallery height.

### Subscription page
<div align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44118951/92344558-159d2600-f0c7-11ea-9e1d-836b5bc2586a.png" alt="Iframe Gallery">
</div>

- A simple page highlighting the author with a contact form that utilises [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/) to send the emails.
- The form has validation and is fully responsive.
- Once the send button is pressed, a modal will open notifying the user that the message is sending.
- The modal has fields that are modified by the `sendMail.js` script.
- A success or an error message will be displayed depending on the result.
- The form fields will be cleared only on a successful response.
- A response message is sent to every email received, set up in EmailJS as a template.

## Additional Features
### Image Loading Blur
- All images utilise a loading blur function to smooth out their loading as the high-quality images can slow things down.
- The function places a low-quality thumbnail as the default image, covering it with a CSS blur filter.
- Simultaneously, it loads the full quality image set as the background image. Once it detects it is loaded it adds a class.
- The class makes the thumbnail transparent, using animation to smooth the transition.
- Had to be carefully used to correctly open the image modal.

### Admin page
- All data coming in and out of the website can be controlled here via CRUD.
- Comments from users may be validated and confirmed here.
- Newsletters and posts may be created.

## Feature Ideas
### Basic
- All links are placeholders for now, leading to the socal page. For this blog to be fully function social pages would nee to be made and linked
- The ability to reply to indevidual comments to create a thread type discussion would be very good for interactivity
- Some kind of monitization in terms of newsletter content or behind the scenes.
- Generally the style if good, but could do with an actual designer.

### General Testing
- Each feature was developed and tested in its own branch before being merged with master. Branches were subsequently deleted.
- Each time a feature was added, all the functions were tested to see if there was an impact.
- The site was sent to friends for feedback and testing, this also allowed for different operating systems and browser testing.
- All forms have validation and will not submit without the proper information.
- .gitignore file has been included to prevent system file commits as well as hide any sensitive information and reduce the ease of malicious attacks.
- Image upload functions have been tested with different formats and sizes.
- External links open in a new tab. Also being tested on multiple devices on multiple browsers.
- Attempts at accessing the admin page have tested; when altering the url.
- attempts attempts at altering other users comments through url manipulation are not possibel.

### Mobile Testing
- I tested the site personally on my Android device, going through every function; checking buttons, forms, logging in/out, etc. I was personally unable to test on iOS.
- The site was sent to friends and relatives for them to follow the same process. They have tested on their devices, including iOS.
- Duckduckgo was utilised to inspect the site in mobile format, going through the pages and functions.

### Desktop Testing
- The site was developed on a Thinkpad and the majority of testing occurred through Firefox.
- The site was tested by friends and relatives on numerous desktop devices.
- The site was marginally tested on other browsers, such as Firefox and Chrome.
- Internet Explorer was not tested and the site was not developed with it in mind as support for the browser is gradually being dropped.

## Bugs
### Known Bugs
- Occasionally on a device with low RAM, the Google Maps API won't load.
- Devices with low RAM may have stuttered animations.
- Offline, using the backup map, the images don't switch the first time the page loads. No errors are shown on the console. A refresh usually solves the issue.
- Very slow connections may have users see the thumbnails pop in during iframe loading, rather than having the switch occur during the animation.

### Fixed Bugs
- Jumbotron image wouldn't de-blur. Fixed by adding a custom class for selection and differentiation.
- Markers wouldn't load if the connection to the API was slow. Fixed by adding a backup array to be used as a fall-back.
- EmailJS wasn't allowing newsletters to be sent on the contact page. Fixed by giving each form a separate ID.
- The map info window wouldn't dispose of itself but would open multiple instances, one over the other. Fixed by moving the initialisation instance outside of the click function.
- The info window would concatenate one country's information with another after clicked. Fixed by clearing the info window content on each click before populating it with info.
- If a country had multiple first languages, the info window would have a display that clipped them as they were stored in an array themselves. Fixed by writing a custom function to deal with languages.
- All map markers would bounce if they had animations set to active. Fixed by looping through the markers and setting them to no animation before activating the clicked marker's animation.
- The modal for images in the gallery wouldn't open because of the blur function. Fixed by changing the HTML structure on the page and the iframe.
- One I added SASS, many of the site's display features were broken. Fixed by cleaning up the CSS files and removing clashing styles.

    git clone https://github.com/Ri-Dearg/neverlost-thrift
    ```
    To disconnect it from the master repository, use:
    ```
    git remote rm origin
    ```
2. Open your IDE and choose the base directory.
3. Here you can install SASS with npm, if you choose, with:
    ```
    npm install -g sass
    ```
4. Run the compiler with:
    ```
    sass --watch assets/css/bootstrap_sass:assets/css
    ```
    This will also watch the bootstrap_sass folder for changes and re-compile the CSS when they are made. This way you can make changes quickly and not worry about re-compiling.
6. Switch the user token for EmailJS with your own. It can be found in the head tag:
    ```
    (function () {
        emailjs.init("<your user token>");
    })();
    ```
5. Run the project with your chosen method. You can drop index.html into a web browser and it should run fine, open a local port and access it or, if you have python installed, run it on an HTTP server with python with a command such as:
    ```
    python3 -m http.server
    ```
6. Enjoy the site!

## Github Deployment
### Github Preparation
- It is possible to copy or clone the repository to directly for deployment, but you will have to compile the make sure the SCSS compiles correctly first. Github Pages' Jekyll themes support this but you will have to make some customisations. Details can be found [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/assets/).
**Requirements:**
- A free GitHub account.
- A free EmailJS account.
