## Visual Design
### Wireframes
The wireframes were done using [wirify](https://www.wirify.com/)
#### The home page
<div align="center">
  <img src="static/images/wireframhome.png" alt="Fonts">
</div>

#### A blog post
<div align="center">
  <img src="static/images/wireframepost.png" alt="Fonts">
</div>

### Fonts
<div align="center">
  <img src="static/images/nav.png" alt="Fonts">
</div>

- The primary font, [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?query=roboto) was chosen because it is minimal, and easy to read while remaining refined. As a font, it gave me the impression of something utilitarian but comfortable. Being clear, clean and simple, maintaining the idea of a minimalist aesthetic. 
- The secondary font, [Times new Roman](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/times-new-roman) was chosen because it is standard, plain and informative but not too rigid. It looks friendly and conversational but holds a seriousness. It is also serif, making it very easily readable throughout different color schemes and complementary to the font used for the blogs.
- Other fonts default to the system-ui CSS font family. This uses the default font of the user's operating system, providing a consistent and familiar appearance across different platforms.

### Icons
<div align="center">
  <img src="static/images/icon.png" alt="Icons">
</div>

- Icons are taken from the [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) Icon library.
- Icons are utilized in the footer for social account icons and for now only lead to the main social media website.

### Colors
<div align="center">
  <img src="static/images/colorthing.jpg" alt="Color Pallette">
</div>

- I wanted the site to maintain a minimal and dark aesthetic, colors pop on the black background but remain, clean to highlight the content of the images and text.
- The primary color used is rich black, avoiding the designers bane of full black. This is used to create a comfortable viewing experience I have come to personally love. This not only helps to ease strain on the eyes but draw them directly from the logo to the content. This removes distraction, a common practice in theatre, cinemas, etc. White is often used in galleries but has more to do with lighting and reflection. On most computer screens, wherein the light is emitted from the screen, black is a better choice.
- Two accent colors were chosen, the blue to give a welcoming introduction and red to make the color contrast as well as make unmistakable the button highlights. These color choices are necessary to have an impact and lead the reader on this dark background.
- Text is primarily written in off-white to contrast on the dark color backgrounds of the primary and accent colors.

### Blogs
<div align="center">
  <img src="static/images/homepage.png" alt="Images">
</div>

- The site has a heavy focus on blogs, using full-size quality images to draw in th viewer.
- In the main gallery, blogs are displayed in three columns responsively, so they can easily be seen on any size device.
- Clicking on a blog will open up a full-page modal that displays the image alongside the blog content, in detail.
- The image and text will automatically space themselves vertically within the column, so the blog remains readable.

### Styling
<div align="center">
  <img src="static/images/postpage.png" alt="Images">
</div>
- For this project I have utilized Bootstrap 5.3 source files to override their class defaults to my liking, making customization much easier. The entire site can be restyled with a single switch in the code.
- Utilizing CSS, all images on the home page have rounded corners on the top, providing a comfortable entrance to the page, contrast to the harsh and often unappealing nature of sharp corners.
- As the site has a beeline focus on use, links on each page are re-used to direct the user to either the home page for other blogs or the collaboration page.
- Interactivity is paramount to any blog and as such, comments are spread and easily accessible to logged in users, providing a place to share thoughts and exchange opinions.

## Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)
### Database Schema Overview

<img src="static/images/ERD.png" alt="Medium Header">

The database created follows a Django-based structure with authentication, user management, and content tracking. Below are the key entities and their relationships complimenting the above generated ERD diagram.

1. **User Management:**
   - `auth_user`: Stores registered users with attributes like `username`, `email`, `password`, and role flags.
   - `auth_group`: Defines user groups or roles.
   - `auth_permission`: Manages permissions assigned to users or groups.
   - **Relationships:**
     - `auth_user_groups`: Links users to groups (many-to-many).
     - `auth_user_user_permissions`: Links users to permissions (many-to-many).
     - `auth_group_permissions`: Links groups to permissions (many-to-many).

2. **Content and Logging:**
   - `django_content_type`: Tracks Django model registrations.
   - `django_admin_log`: Logs administrative actions, linking to `auth_user` and `django_content_type`.

3. **Sessions and Migrations:**
   - `django_session`: Manages user sessions.
   - `django_migrations`: Tracks database schema changes.

### General Testing
- Each feature was developed and tested in its own branch before being merged with master. Branches were subsequently deleted.
- Each time a feature was added, all the functions were tested to see if there was an impact.
- The site was sent to friends for feedback and testing, this also allowed for different operating systems and browser testing.
- All forms have validation and will not submit without the proper information.
- .gitignore file has been included to prevent system file commits as well as hide any sensitive information and reduce the ease of malicious attacks.
- Image upload functions have been tested with different formats and sizes.
- External links open in a new tab. Also being tested on multiple devices on multiple browsers.
- Attempts at accessing the admin page have tested; when altering the url.
- Attempts attempts at altering other users comments through url manipulation are not possible.

### Mobile Testing
- I tested the site personally on my Android device, going through every function; checking buttons, forms, logging in/out, etc. I was personally unable to test on iOS.
- The site was sent to friends and relatives for them to follow the same process. They have tested on their devices, including iOS.
- Duckduckgo was utilized to inspect the site in mobile format, going through the pages and functions.

### Desktop Testing
- The site was developed on a Thinkpad and the majority of testing occurred through Firefox.
- The site was tested by friends and relatives on numerous desktop devices.
- The site was marginally tested on other browsers, such as Firefox and Chrome.
- Internet Explorer was not tested and the site was not developed with it in mind as support for the browser is gradually being dropped.

## Bugs
### Known Bugs
- Currently not fully set up for newsletters. This would require an email setup.

### Fixed Bugs
- contrast on dark background was not high enough for accessability and was changed to a bright text on darker background
- Comments were not accessible from the admin page, fixed by connecting the comments via adding to the urls
- Delete comment confirmation was not visible. Fixed by adding text-black to the content.
- The subscribe button was throwing errors and breaking the entire website when a link was added. This was fixed by removing the 'a' tag and replacing it with a form and an action= instead of an href. 
- Many more bugs were fixed but non as largely breaking as the ones above.
